In case of var, variable gets declared at the top of the function i.e. hoisting is happening,
In this case declared globally 
that is why the result will be "undefined"

In case of let, hoisting is not happening, 
that is why error will come , it is not defined

It is good practice to use let instead of var

we have block scoping with let keyword but with var keyword we do not have block scoping
